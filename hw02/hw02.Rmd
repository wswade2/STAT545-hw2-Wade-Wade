Welcome to my Stat 545 hw02 page. In this homework assignment, I will be exploring the gapminder dataset by using the dplyr package that we learned about during class.

First, I will load the packages I need:
```{r}
require(tidyverse)
require(gapminder)

```

The gapminder dataset is <b>rectangular</b> data, which means, as far as I can surmise, that the if you look at all of the data at once it literally is shaped like a rectangle.



```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```



```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
